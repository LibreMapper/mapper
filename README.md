# LibreMapper

LibreMapper is a free and open source cartographic software tailored for
orienteering map making. Unlike GIS or graphic software, LibreMapper supports
the map maker's orienteering field survey routine and helps to perfect the
graphic map content.

## Helping to make the software better

If you encounter issues while using LibreMapper, or just want to spend some
good time coding for the project, please refer to the
[Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/LibreMapper/mapper/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
